## Why Goals Were Not Completed
- The login page was put on hold for higher priority tasks such as getting the manager
  and server side working in both the backend and frontend.
- The backend was completed towards the end of the sprint, so testing it has not been
  fully completed
- Some SQL methods need to be updated to work with the new project to enable features
  such as dynamic buttons and editing all inventory item columns


## What went wrong
- Genrally nothing went wrong
- The sprint began slow, so we had to speed up in the end

## What went right
- Trello board is working well
- Discord has helped communication
- We learned to work separately and connect the frontend and backend seamlessly
- We became more organized during this project
- Everyone is participating more

## What needs to change
- Coordinate better in sprint start
- Make sure everyone has something to do at the start of the sprint
